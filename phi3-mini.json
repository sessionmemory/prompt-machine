However, it's important to note that while this date is widely recognized and celebrated, some Christian denominations observe it on January 7th, following the Julian calendar used by many churches before the Gregorian calendar was adopted in 1582. Additionally, Christmas as a cultural holiday can also incorporate various traditions and celebrations around December 24th (Christmas Eve) and January 6th (Epiphany or Three Kings' Day).",
