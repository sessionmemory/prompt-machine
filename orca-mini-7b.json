        "response": " To find out how long it will take the person to walk 10 miles, we need to divide the total distance by the speed at which they are walking.\n\nDistance = 10 miles\nSpeed = 4 miles/hour\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 10 miles / 4 miles/hour\nTime = 2.5 hours\n\nSo, it will take the person 2.5 hours to walk 10 miles.",

        "response": " The theory of relativity, specifically the special theory of relativity, was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the laws of gravity and how objects with mass interact at the molecular, atomic, and subatomic levels. \n\nThe main idea behind the theory of relativity is the concept of relative time and distance. According to this theory, there are two fundamental laws:\n1. The law of relativistic addition of velocities: This law states that the combined velocity of two objects is not equal to the sum of their individual velocities. Instead, it depends on both their velocities and masses. \n2. The law of relativistic length contraction: This law states that objects that are in motion appear shorter than they actually are when measured by an observer who is at rest. \n\nThese two laws lead to several other predictions, including the famous equation E=mc\u00b2, which is often referred to as \"the most important equation in physics.\" It demonstrates how mass and energy are interchangeable, with a single gram of mass possessing an equivalent amount of energy (E) equal to that of about 9 \u00d7 108 joules.\n\nThe theory of relativity has been tested numerous times and has passed all experimental tests. It plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of gravity, space, and time and has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world around us.",
