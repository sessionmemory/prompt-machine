well I think all internet companies you know the the stocks are incredibly volatile and I've you know but even longm it longterm I believe that it's very easy to predict that they're going to be lots of successful companies born of the internet they're going to have very large market caps and and and so on I also believe that today where we sit it's very hard to predict who those companies are going to be uh so you know you can make bets on these things and I think that amazon.com if we don't if we're not one of those important lasting companies born of the internet we will have nobody to blame but ourselves and that we will be extremely disappointed in ourselves but there are no guarantees uh it's very very hard to predict if you go back and look at the companies created by the PC Revolution uh in 1980 you probably wouldn't have predicted the five winners uh you know the five biggest winners there have been lots of winners actually so this space is a little different and brand name May May mean more and and and there's some increasing returns kinds of things may mean more but I believe that if you can focus obsessively enough on customer experience selection ease of use low prices more information to make uh purchase decisions with if you can give customers all that plus great customer service and with our uh toys and electronics we have a 30-day uh return policy if you can do all of that then I think you have a good chance and that's what we're trying to do you're not really a pure internet company uh anymore either are you I mean you've got millions of square feet now of real estate you've got uh a a growing huge and growing inventory of items you keep in stock and you've got thousands and thousands of employees now yeah we have over 3,000 employees and over 4 million square ft of distribution space and those are things I'm very very proud of because with that Distribution Center space and half a dozen distribution centers around the country it allows us to get product close to customers so that we can ship it to customers in a very timely way which improves customer service levels that's what we're about if there's one thing amazon.com is about it's obsessive attention to the customer experience end to end and that's what those distribution but you're not a pure internet play it doesn't I I it doesn't matter to me whether we're a pure internet player what matters to me is do we provide the best customer service Internet schnet it's that's you know that that doesn't matter well but it does matter to your investors to know whether they're investing in a company that is no they should be investing in a company that obsesses over customer experience in the long term there is never any misalignment between customer interests and shareholder interests well that's the same argument that uh somebody at Walmart would make as well wouldn't they I I don't see why not I think they should make that argument so uh it's a correct argument okay so so you'll open as many square feet of space physical space as you have to hire as many employees as you have to to service customers absolutely and we'll do it as rapidly as we can that's a very uh cost intense proposition not compared to opening an equivalent network of retail stores so if you open a bunch of chain stores look when we open a distribution center we're opening places that may have square you know where we may pay uh 30 cents a square foot for uh for a lease instead of paying $7 a square foot which you might pay in a high traffic retail area so when you compare those things they're not the same you can't compare a big chain of of of of retail stores to half a dozen distribution centers it's just not you know it's bad math okay uh either way whichever side of the argument you believe you're making what it seems to me to be there's only one side which is obsess over customers but it seems to me that both with the speed of your growth in terms of the number of stores online that you're opening the different businesses you're getting into the number of distribution centers you're opening in new employees you're hiring uh that you are making an intense gamble here which is uh twofold uh one that you can run this number of businesses different businesses well uh and and two uh that you can make money by selling vast volumes of uh product at essentially Raisor thin profit margins I think that the the first one in particular I agree with wholeheartedly which is that um we're uh there's no guarantee that amazon.com can be a successful company what we're trying to do is very complicated there's huge execution risk involved we have a terribly complicated business we're growing you know historically very rapidly uh we're opening new product categories we're expanding in new geographies we have whole new business models with things like auctions and we think this is the L risky of the two approaches because scale is important in this business and and it you need scale also to offer the lowest prices and the best customer service to people so scale is important to us and we're going to go after that kind of scale but it does mean that the executional challenges are huge and uh so you'll find a bunch of people back in Seattle and around the world working very hard to make sure we service customers at the level that they're used to and then even improving that isn't it to some extent a certain amount of with all due respect um um corporate arrogance to assume that you can come into these businesses which you have no experience in and uh o virtually overnight enter a huge variety of different businesses and become the best in those businesses and the market leader in those businesses and ex those when there are other companies that have been running these types of businesses for decades if not more I don't think so so the the um you know when we first started selling books four years ago we were everybody said look you're just Computer Guys you don't know anything about selling books and that was true but we but we really cared about customers and now we know a lot about books and when we first started selling music people said the same thing but we hired the right people so we don't do this in a vacuum we go out and hire the best industry experts in each of these categories that's the same with toys and electronics so you know we take this very seriously we take the commitments of the customer very seriously and we're not about to uh release something or announce something before it's

        "response": "## Main Points:\n\n**Focus on Customer Experience:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of prioritizing customer experience as a core driver for success, regardless of whether they are a pure internet company.  They believe in \"obsession\" with this aspect and aim to deliver exceptional service across all stages of the customer journey. \n\n**Growth through Scale & Distribution:**  The speaker acknowledges the high risk involved in scaling multiple businesses simultaneously, especially considering the complexity of their operations. However, they believe scale is essential for offering competitive prices and delivering outstanding customer service.  This requires opening numerous distribution centers to ensure swift product delivery and efficient logistics.\n\n**Intense Execution Risk:** The speaker highlights that while there's a great deal of potential in the internet sector,  there are significant execution risks associated with their ambitious expansion strategy. They acknowledge the competitive landscape and believe it will require immense effort and expertise to achieve market dominance within various industries. \n\n**Building Expertise through Hiring:** To mitigate risk and ensure success, Amazon.com strategically hires industry experts across different categories like books, music, toys, and electronics. This is crucial for gaining a deep understanding of these markets and developing a robust product offering.\n\n\n**In Summary:** The speaker champions a customer-centric approach that emphasizes rapid scale, expert hiring, and relentless execution to navigate the challenges and compete in the dynamic online landscape. \n",

        "response": "This text argues that Amazon prioritizes customer experience above all else, even as investors bet on its future success.  The company is taking a gamble on multiple businesses with diverse products and geographical expansion, while emphasizing the importance of scale for customer service and competitive pricing.

        "response": "Based on the text, the most likely name of the person quoted is **Jeff Bezos**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Focus on Customer Service:** The speaker repeatedly emphasizes the importance of customer experience, using phrases like \"obsess over customers,\" \"highest quality customer service,\" and \"we are about serving customers.\"  This aligns with Jeff Bezos' well-documented focus on customer satisfaction as a key driver of Amazon's success.\n* **Physical Expansion:**  The speaker mentions opening new distribution centers and hiring employees to meet growing demand, showcasing an understanding of the need for physical infrastructure alongside online operations like Amazon does. \n* **Risk vs. Reward:** The speaker acknowledges high risk and execution challenges while also highlighting the potential for large-scale success (\"vast volumes,\" \"become the best in those businesses\"). This approach mirrors Bezos' strategy, often taking bold risks to pursue potentially huge rewards.\n* **Competitive Context:**  The speaker discusses competing with established players (\"Walmart\" analogy) and acknowledges the difficulty of entering new markets (\"we have no experience in these types of businesses\").  This is consistent with Bezos' history of challenging traditional business models and entering previously unconquered markets. \n* **Passionate Approach:** The quote emphasizes \"intense gamble,\" \"complicated business,\" and \"huge execution risk.\" This reflects Bezos' approach to business, which combines calculated risks with a deep-rooted passion for his vision.\n\nWhile the quote doesn't explicitly name Jeff Bezos, it contains numerous characteristics consistent with his style of leadership and management at Amazon. \n",
