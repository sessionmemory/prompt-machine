A range of factions emerge who each believe in a different and unique vision for how to set up a second human society on a different exoplanet with different values, philosophies, expertise, and implementation plan. The journey to travel to each exoplanet is longer than any single human's lifespan, so Earthlings must make a decision as to which faction to follow and commit to relocating to that faction's chosen planet and relocation plan, but not for their own personal future, but the future of their offspring and future generations. This makes the decision extremely impactful and important, causing each individual to think deeply about their values, philosophical ideals, and which faction they ultimately believe will be successful, all the while knowing they won't find out if they made the right decision until long after the individual has perished. They are forced to take a perspective beyond their individual self-interests, and think about the greater good of society, humanity, and their community of family and friends.",
