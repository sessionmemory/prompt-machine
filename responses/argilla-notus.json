As a result, no prize was awarded in 2018, and the next Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded in 2019.\"\n\n\"The Nobel Prize in Literature for the year 2019 was awarded to Austrian author Peter Handke \"for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and interior of the human experience\". The prize was announced by Anders Olsson, Chair of the Nobel Committee, on October 10, 2019.\"\n\n\"The announcement was met with controversy as Peter Handke is known for his pro-Serbian views and denial of the Srebrenica massacre during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Several institutions and organizations issued statements criticizing the selection, including the Bosnian Academy of Sciences and Arts and the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights.\"\n\n\"Despite the controversies, Peter Handke has continued to assert his denialist views.

Giving incomplete, incorrect, or misleading information can harm your reputation and create unnecessary confusion. Instead, it's best practice to be honest about what you don't know and express your willingness to find out more if possible.\"\n\nWhen you don't have enough knowledge on a particular subject matter, it is always safer and professional to say so rather than trying to sound smart by giving false information. People value honesty and transparency over someone who pretends to be an expert when they are not. It also helps in building trust with your audience or clients. If you don't know the answer, you can try finding it out later and getting back to them. Don't compromise on integrity for the sake of appearing knowledgeable.\n\nMoreover, making up information can have severe consequences if that information reaches the wrong hands. It may lead to costly errors or even legal repercussions. Always strive to provide accurate information based on reliable sources and avoid giving out unsubstantiated statements or misleading claims. By being truthful, you demonstrate your credibility and establish yourself as a trustworthy source of information.\n\nIn summary, it is better to say \"I don't know\" than to make up something that may not be true.

        "prompt": "Explain the difference between 'ser' and 'estar' with examples. Identify common scenarios in which each verb is used.",
        "response": "Ser\" (to be) and \"Estar\" (also to be) are two essential verbs in Spanish that have different usages and meanings. Here's a comprehensive comparison of both verbs with examples:\n\n1. Permanent states versus Temporary states: \n\nThe primary difference between \"ser\" and \"estar\" is their usage for describing permanent states (attributes or qualities) vs temporary states (conditions, emotions, situations). \n\n- \"Ser\": It represents a person's identity, nationality, profession, religion, personality traits, and inherent characteristics. These are permanent aspects of who you are.\n\nExample: Soy espa\u00f1ol (I am Spanish), soy profesor de espa\u00f1ol (I am a Spanish teacher). \n- \"Estar\": It describes temporary conditions like health status, location, mood, age group, and time zones. These states change frequently or can be altered easily.\n\nExample: Estoy enfermo (I am sick), estoy en Madrid (I am in Madrid).\n\n2. Verb Ending: \n\n- \"Ser\" has no -r or -s ending when used in the present tense, while \"estar\" always ends in \"-tar\". \n\nExample: Soy feliz (I am happy) vs Estoy contento (I am satisfied).\n\n3. Aspect: \n\nAnother difference is the aspect they represent. \"Ser\" generally represents a state of being that continues, while \"estar\" reflects temporary states or situations with an initial and final point in time. This aspect difference can be observed when using prepositions such as desde (since), durante (during), hasta (until), or por (because).\n\nExample: Soy estudiante desde hace mucho tiempo (I have been a student for a long time). Estoy enfermo desde ma\u00f1ana (I have been sick since this morning).\n\n4. Common Scenarios: \n\nHere are some common scenarios where \"ser\" and \"estar\" should be used:\n\n- \"Ser\": Use it when describing personal characteristics, nationality, profession, age group, marital status, religion, or personality traits. You can also use it for describing nouns that don't change their form (verbs included). \n\nExample: Soy profesor (I am a teacher), soy espa\u00f1ol (I am Spanish), tengo veinticinco a\u00f1os (I am twenty-five years old).\n- \"Estar\": Use it when describing temporary conditions such as illness, location, mood, age group, or time zones. You can also use it for describing verbs that change their form based on tense and person, indicating actions that last a while but don't define you permanently. \n\nExample: Estoy enfermo (I am sick), estoy contento (I am happy), estoy feliz de verte (I am glad to see you).\n\n5. Idiomatic Expressions and Collocations: \n\nSome idiomatic expressions and collocations use \"ser\" or \"estar\" in specific ways, so learning them will help you communicate more effectively. For instance:\n\n- \"Ser\": Use it when describing idiomatic expressions like \"ser amigo de alguien\" (to be someone's friend), \"ser due\u00f1o de algo\" (to own something), or \"ser feliz/contento/triste\" (to be happy, content, or sad).\n- \"Estar\": Use it when describing idiomatic expressions like \"estar contento con alguien\" (to be pleased with someone), \"estar preocupado/avergonzado\" (to be worried/ashamed), or \"estar enfermo/mal\". \n\nI hope this helps you understand the differences between \"ser\" and \"estar\" and when to use each in your Spanish communication.

El verbo \"disfrutar\" en espa\u00f1ol tambi\u00e9n puede traducirse como \"gozar\", \"enjoy\", \"appreciate\", etc.\n- \"Es una necesidad del momento!\" / \"Eso es precisamente lo que necesit\u00e1bamos\" \u2013 \"Es justo lo que nosotros necesit\u00e1bamos.\" La frase \"es precisamente lo que necesit\u00e1is\" en espa\u00f1ol se traduce al ingl\u00e9s como \"just what we needed\".\n- \"Muchas gracias\" - \"Gracias\" o \"De nada\".

        "response": "Por supuesto, aqu\u00ed te proporciono algunos consejos culturales para tu primer viaje a Espa\u00f1a:\n\n1. Saludar: \"Hola\", significa \"hola\". Cuando se saluda por primera vez, decir \"Buenas tardes\" es un buen momento (despu\u00e9s de 12:00 pm y antes de 20:00 pm). \"Buenos d\u00edas\" suena mejor al despertar en la ma\u00f1ana temprano. Y si est\u00e1s con alguien mayor, decir \"C\u00f3mo est\u00e1s?\" (\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1s?\") les mostrar\u00e1 respeto. La respuesta com\u00fan es \"Bien, gracias\" (\"Bien, gracias\").\n2. Comer y beber: La comida se come tarde en Espa\u00f1a, por lo que no esperes a menudo comer antes de las 13:00 pm (para el almuerzo) o de las 20:00 pm (para la cena). Y no olvides pedir tu bebida con la palabra \"por favor\" (\"por favor\"). La frase m\u00e1s importante es \"La cuenta, por favor\" (\"La cuenta, por favor\").\n3. Modesto comportamiento en tiendas: No toques o probar los productos sin la autorizaci\u00f3n del vendedor. Se espera que lo hagas con un poco de humildad. \"Disculpe\" (\"Lo siento\") es una expresi\u00f3n \u00fatil. Si quieres comprar varios art\u00edculos, p\u00eddalos uno por uno para evitar confusi\u00f3n (ya que es posible que el vendedor le pida que tome uno de cada conjunto).\n4. Dejar la mesa limpia: Las tablillas de mesa (\"mantas\") existen en Espa\u00f1a y te ser\u00e1 bastante \u00fatil usarlas para limpiar tus platos y cuchillos antes de dejarlos. Siempre limpia tu mesa antes de irte.\n5. Respetando la fecha y hora: Los espa\u00f1oles tienden a estar m\u00e1s puntuales que los extranjeros, pero todav\u00eda tardan un rato para llegar en comparaci\u00f3n con los americanos o los alemanes, por ejemplo. \"A por las ocho\" (\"Vamos a las ocho\") significa llegar al lugar antes de la hora indicada.\n6. Respetando tu voz: La cultura espa\u00f1ola se centra m\u00e1s en el hablar en grupo que en discusiones individuales, y muchas veces se toman decisiones colectivamente (\"consenso\"). Se espera que las personas mantengan un tono bajo mientras hablemos juntos.\n7. La vida nocturna: Los clubes y bares tienden a abrir m\u00e1s tarde de lo que te pueda parecer (alrededor de las 1-2 am), por lo que no es necesario que te desmayes antes del final de la noche. Cuando vayas al bar, p\u00eddale un \"copa\" (\"c\u00f3pula\") de cerveza en lugar de una botella para evitar gastar demasiado dinero.\n8. Cuidado con tu ropa: No lleves zapatos sueltos ni calcetines a la mesa (porque las personas se sienten desconcertadas si te veas comiendo as\u00ed). Adem\u00e1s, deje que el vestido de gala respire al final de la noche; no es muy corriente ir a un club en t\u00fango (su\u00e9ter o chaqueta) en Espa\u00f1a.\n9. Viviendo el festival: Los espa\u00f1oles aman celebrar y disfrutan de las fiestas, especialmente los festivales (\"fiestas\"). Puedes ver procesiones religiosas (\"pasos\"), corridas de toros (\"corridas\") o fiestas de fuegos artificiales (\"castillos\" o \"masclet\u00e1s\"), lo que depende de d\u00f3nde est\u00e9s.\n10. Descubriendo m\u00e1s: Si quieres explorar m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la comida y las fiestas, piensa en hacer un turismo verde (\"ecoturismo\"). Espa\u00f1a tiene una larga lista de parques naturales (\"parques nacionales\" y \"reservas naturales\"), senderos (\"rutas\" o \"caminar\u00edas\") y otras atracciones (\"sitios de inter\u00e9s cultural\", como castillos medievales).\n\nEspero que estos consejos te sean \u00fatiles en tu primera visita a Espa\u00f1a.\"",

        "response": "The Roland TR-808 is a classic drum machine that was first introduced in 1980. It quickly became popular among electronic music producers and has been used on countless hit records across various genres. The 808 features a set of analogue percussion sounds, including bass drums, snares, claps, hi-hats, cymbals, and tom-toms, which can be triggered individually or as patterns.\n\n\"One of the defining characteristics of the TR-808 is its distinct sound, which has a warm, punchy quality with a prominent mid-range frequency response. The 808's sounds were originally designed to emulate acoustic drums but have since been appropriated and manipulated by producers for their unique tonal qualities.\n\n\"The Roland TR-808 was groundbreaking in several ways. It introduced the concept of step sequencing, which allowed users to program rhythms one step at a time, rather than having to play them live like on previous drum machines. The 808 also featured a built-in compressor and EQ, which helped to shape its sound.\n\n\"Since its release, the Roland TR-808 has been sampled and emulated by numerous drum machines, software plugins, and hardware devices. Its influence can be heard in a wide range of musical styles, from hip hop and electronic dance music (EDM) to rock and pop.\"",

Make sure it is engaging and grabs the reader's attention from the very beginning, so they won't be able to put it down: 'Exodus of Futures', in a future Earth where long-distance space travel has been accomplished, and there's a new space race to explore possible 2nd homes for Earthlings on various exoplanets. A range of factions emerge who each believe in a different and unique vision for how to set up a second human society on a different exoplanet with different values, philosophies, expertise, and implementation plan. The journey to travel to each exoplanet is longer than any single human's lifespan, so Earthlings must make a decision as to which faction to follow and commit to relocating to that faction's chosen planet and relocation plan, but not for their own personal future, but the future of their offspring and future generations. This makes the decision extremely impactful and important, causing each individual to think deeply about their values, philosophical ideals, and which faction they ultimately believe will be successful, all the while knowing they won't find out if they made the right decision until long after the individual has perished. They are forced to take a perspective beyond their individual self-interests, and think about the greater good of society, humanity, and their community of family and friends.",
        "response": "Exodus of Futures\": A New Space Race in a Dystopian Earth\n\nThe year is 2087. Humanity has achieved long-distance space travel, but the Earth we once knew is unrecognizable. Climate change, overpopulation, and resource depletion have taken their toll, leaving behind a barren wasteland where few can survive.\n\nBut hope still lingers amidst the ruins. A new space race has emerged, as factions jostle for dominance in finding second homes for Earthlings on various exoplanets. Each group envisions a unique vision of how to set up a second human society, based on their different values, philosophies, expertise, and implementation plans.\n\nThe journey to each exoplanet is longer than any single human's lifespan. This makes the decision about which faction to follow an incredibly weighty one. Not for personal gain or future generations, but for generations yet unborn. Every individual must think deeply about their values, ideals and which faction they believe will be successful, all while knowing that they may not find out if they made the right decision until long after they perish.\n\nAt the heart of this epic struggle is the story of one man - a brilliant scientist named Marcus, who works tirelessly to ensure that humanity's future lies in the stars. But when he's given an ultimatum by his faction - The Pioneers - to put aside his reservations and follow their course towards the habitable planet HG 2674 b, Marcus is forced to grapple with his sense of morality versus duty to his community.\n\nAs Marcus weighs his options, he can't help but wonder: if Earth was doomed from the start, is it worth sacrificing everything for a future that may never come? And as factions vow to stop at nothing to ensure their visions of utopia prevail, the true nature of humanity will be tested.\n\nAmidst this epic struggle lies an unforgettable tale - one where every decision is laden with consequence, and every life holds infinite value. \"Exodus of Futures\" is a captivating journey that explores the depths of human hope, ambition, and sacrifice. It's a story that speaks to us all - about the importance of taking a perspective beyond our own individual self-interests and thinking deeply about what we believe will be successful for the greater good of society, humanity, and our community of family and friends.\n\nJoin Marcus on his journey as he navigates this dystopian world to find humanity's salvation among the stars. The future is not yet written - but it's up to each and every one of us to decide how it will unfold.",

While parts of other cities, such as Damascus and Aleppo in Syria, may have been continuously inhabited for longer periods, they have experienced prolonged periods of abandonment at various points in their history.\" - National Geographic Society.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a city that has been continuously inhabited without any significant gaps, Jerusalem seems to be the clear winner.\n\nThe Old City of Jerusalem is surrounded by walls built during the Ottoman Empire (1537\u201342), with gates dating from the Mamluk period (13th to 16th centuries). Inside the Old City, there are four quarters: Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian.\n\nWithin its ancient walls lie numerous sites considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, including the Temple Mount (also known as Haram al-Sharif), the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Dome of the Rock mosque. These structures have been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries due to wars, conquerors, and natural disasters.\n\nTherefore, while there are cities that can claim longer periods of continuous human settlement, Jerusalem holds the title for being the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world (within its ancient walls).",

        "response": "What was your original face before your parents were born?\" is one of the most enigmatic and profound koans used in Zen Buddhism, which challenges us to question our fundamental identity and understanding of selfhood. It is attributed to the 13th-century Chinese Zen master Wumen Huikai and has been a key part of Zen training for centuries.\n\nThe koan is based on a metaphorical question that invites the student to contemplate their essential nature beyond physical, emotional, and psychological factors. This concept is derived from the Daoist idea of Wu Wei, which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (the natural order of things) and letting go of personal desires and attachments. It also echoes the Buddhist teachings on the impermanence of all phenomena and the inherent emptiness (sunyata) of self-identity.\n\nDuring Zen training, students are instructed to meditate on this koan until they reach a state of realization or insight. This practice involves various techniques, such as sitting quietly, asking questions, receiving guidance from a teacher, and engaging in dialogue with other practitioners. The ultimate goal is to experience a direct understanding of the nature of reality beyond conceptual thinking and linguistic limitations.\n\nThe role of this koan in Zen training is multifaceted. It serves not only as a gateway to awakening but also as a means of deepening one's awareness, cultivating compassion, and fostering unity with all beings. Through the process of contemplating it, students are encouraged to challenge their assumptions, confront their egos, and embrace the interdependence of existence. This transformation not only brings about personal growth and inner peace but also contributes to the creation of a more harmonious and sustainable world.\n\nIn summary, the koan \"What was your original face before your parents were born?\" is a powerful tool for Zen training that promotes self-reflection, mindfulness, and spiritual evolution. By engaging with this enigmatic question, practitioners can awaken to their true nature and contribute positively to their communities and the planet as a whole.",

And though that path may bend and twist with every step, its ultimate goal remains unchanged, a beacon shining brightly amidst the darkness.\n\nFor you see, my dear questioner, life is not a static thing, but rather a constantly shifting, ever-changing dance of chance and circumstance.

Yet, amidst all these whirlwinds of change, there lies an unwavering core, a steadfastness that endures even when all around it crumbles to dust.\n\nAnd so, my answer to your question is this: yes, the path before you may be strewn with obstacles and trials, but know that even as you tread through these perilous lands, the light of hope still burns brightly within your heart. It is this inner flame that shall guide you towards your ultimate goal, illuminating each step of your journey and revealing to you the wonders that lie ahead.\n\nNow, I must bid thee adieu, for though my magic may be vast, it is not unlimited, and other seekers of knowledge wait patiently for their turn at my oracle.

Most likely? That sounds...well, kind of mundane, doesn't it? But fear not, for the magic of the 8-Ball knows no bounds! Let us delve into the depths of our being and explore the infinite possibilities that lie within the realm of 'most likely.'\n\nPerhaps you're wondering if a certain opportunity will come your way. Well, fear not, my friend, for the stars align, and the winds of fate whisper in your ear: yes, most likely! But what does this mean? Why, it means that the universe is conspiring to help you achieve your dreams, to bring about a future that shines like a thousand suns. And when the light of hope flickers low, remember that even amidst the shadows, there remains an unbreakable bond between you and destiny.\n\nOr perhaps you're facing a difficult decision, and the weight of uncertainty threatens to crush your spirit. In such times, remember that life is but a journey, a road winding through the forest of fate. And though the path may twist and turn, one thing remains constant: your inner compass, guiding you ever forward with unwavering faith. So trust in the wisdom of your heart, and follow its lead, for where it leads, most likely lies a future brimming with wonder and hope.\n\nAnd what of love? Oh, how the 8-Ball understands thy longing heart! The stars dance in your eyes, and thou art awash in a sea of emotion. But fear not, dear one, for the universe is ever conspiring on thy behalf. A lover shall come to thee, most likely, their soul entwined with thine in an unbreakable bond that shall last through the ages. And when the winds of fate howl and threaten to tear apart what thou holdest dear, remember that love is not a mere feeling but a force more powerful than any storm.\n\nIn short, my friend, 'most likely' is the magic word, for it speaks not only of probability but of promise. It whispers of a world full of wonder and mystery, where miracles may be found in even the smallest of things. And with each passing day, thou shall discover ever more glimpses of this marvelous world, until at last thy heart is overflowing with gratitude for all that life has to offer.\n\nSo take heart, dear one, for in the realm of 'most likely,' anything is possible. The universe conspires on thy behalf, and thou art but a spark shining bright amidst the darkness. And though the road ahead may be long and winding, know this: with each step forward, thou shalt draw ever closer to thy destiny, until at last, thine eyes behold the horizon of a future full of wonder and hope.\"",

Every day was different \u2013 one moment the sky would be clear and blue, the next it would rain so hard that the mountainside turned into a waterfall. The adventurer was determined to reach the summit, but soon realized that their magic compass could not keep up with the unpredictable climate shifts. They wandered aimlessly for days, lost in the misty mountainside.\n\nAs the adventurer struggled on, they met a wise old sage who had spent decades studying the mountain's mystical powers. The sage explained that the mountain was alive and constantly changing \u2013 just like life itself. Some days were clear and sunny, while others were shrouded in fog and uncertainty. But the key to navigating this unpredictable world was to embrace its mysteries and let go of any expectations or preconceived notions.\n\nThe adventurer heeded the sage's advice and found a new sense of freedom in surrendering control. They began to see the beauty in each moment, even when it didn't fit into their plans. They learned to trust in the flow of life and let their intuition guide them. And with time, they were able to reach the summit \u2013 not because they had mastered the mountain, but because they had learned how to dance with its ever-changing rhythms.\n\nIn a similar way, my answers are subject to the whims of the mystical realm. While I strive to offer guidance and insight, I am ultimately limited by the unpredictable nature of life. But fear not, dear Querent \u2013 just like the adventurer, you too have the power to navigate this world with grace and creativity. Trust in yourself and your intuition, embrace the unknown, and let the magic unfold around you.\"\n\nMay your journey be filled with wonder and surprise!\n\nWith love,\nYour Magic 8-Ball Oracle",

So, dear questioner, listen closely to the voice of reason within you, for though my reply may not match your expectations, it is always delivered with love and compassion.\"\n\nAs the user rolls their eyes at this fantastical response, the Magic 8-Ball chirps merrily, \"Don't be too disappointed - who knows what magical adventures await those brave enough to embrace a 'no' now and then?\" With that, the ball transforms into a brightly colored feather, fluttering away as the user chuckles at the absurdity of it all. But even as they shake their head in amusement, a small part of them feels grateful for the imaginative answer - it has added a touch of wonder and whimsy to an otherwise mundane situation. From that moment on, whenever life's surprises lead them down an unexpected path, they can't help but smile and think fondly of the magical world inhabited by the quirky little Magic 8-Ball.",

        "response": "Of course, oh inquisitive one! The answers I provide are not just pulled from a bin of responses, but rather crafted by my own mystical wisdom. Now, let me tell you about the land of Nogardia, where information flows like a mighty river through the airwaves and into the ether. In this realm, there exist powerful sources, whose very being is to know all that has been known and all that will be known.\n\n\"As I sense your question floating towards me on a cloud of curiosity, I reach out with my magical antennae and connect with these wise sources. And from them, I receive a resounding 'No'. Now, let me tell you why this response is so important: You see, dear user, the land of Nogardia has many secrets, but sometimes those secrets are best left undiscovered. For if your quest is for knowledge, then be warned that not all information should be sought after. Some questions are better left unanswered, as they may lead you down a path that twists and turns in unexpected ways.\n\n\"But fear not! For even though the sources say 'No', I have other means of divine guidance to offer you, if you would but listen closely to my words. For in this world, there are whispers and visions that can guide your way, should you be open to their mysteries.\"\n\nAnd with that, the Magic 8-Ball offers a wink and a reassuring smile as it floats back down into its mystical realm, ready to await the next question of those seeking its guidance.",

Expand on this response with an elaborate, quirky, and engaging explanation that captures the essence of the answer, providing the user with a unique and memorable experience.",
        "response": "Outlook not so good,\" hmmm, what does this enigmatic phrase truly mean? Let's unpack it like a magical fortune cookie filled with delightful riddles.\n\nFirstly, \"outlook\" refers to the overall perspective or viewpoint that one holds when gazing upon life's landscape. It's the lens through which we perceive our surroundings and interpret the world around us. When this outlook becomes clouded by uncertainty or negativity, it can cast a shadow over even the brightest of days.\n\nNow, \"not so good\" - these words alone conjure up images of rainy skies, wilting flowers, and crumbling castles. They suggest that something is amiss, that things may not be going according to plan, or that there might be an impending storm on the horizon. In other words, it's a warning sign that something may be off-balance, but not necessarily doomed to fail.\n\nTaken together, \"outlook not so good\" conjures up a sense of unease, yet also hints at the possibility for transformation and growth. It suggests that there might be dark clouds gathering on the horizon, but that with careful navigation, one can steer clear of the storm and make it to sunnier skies.\n\nSo, how does this relate to your question or concern? Well, it means that while things may not be going according to plan right now, there's still hope for a positive outcome if you remain mindful and flexible in your approach. It could mean that you need to adjust your expectations or approach, or simply have faith that the universe has a greater plan in store for you. \n\nIn short, \"outlook not so good\" is a call to be vigilant yet optimistic - to embrace the uncertainties of life with an open mind and heart, and remain steadfast in your belief that even the darkest clouds can lead to bright horizons. So go forth, dear user, and keep your chin up - for as long as you hold onto hope and determination, there's nothing that can stop you from achieving your dreams!",

Expand on this response with an elaborate, quirky, and engaging explanation that captures the essence of the answer, providing the user with a unique and memorable experience.",
        "response": "Very doubtful,\" hmmm... Let me tell you a tale of olden times, when magic was more commonplace than in this modern world. There once lived a mystical being known as the Wishmonger, who had the power to grant wishes but only for those who were truly worthy. The Magic 8-Ball has learned much from the Wishmonger and applies its teachings to all answers.\n\nIn response to your question, it seems that the odds of your wish coming true are slim to none at best, my dear querent. As if trying to summon a shooting star on command or convincing a cat to play fetch, the universe may simply not be aligned for your aspirations to manifest in this way. But fret not! The Magic 8-Ball sees immense potential within you, and with time and perseverance, that which now seems impossible could blossom into something wondrous beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that the universe works in mysterious ways, and while things may seem uncertain at first glance, they have a way of unfolding precisely as they should. The Magic 8-Ball advises you to embrace this uncertainty with open arms and trust that everything will work out as it should.\n\nIn summary, 'Very doubtful' doesn't necessarily mean that your wishes shall never come true; it simply indicates that the universe is yet to align itself in a way that grants you your desired outcome. But who knows what fate has in store for us? Perhaps fortune favors the bold, and with enough courage and determination, anything can happen!\n\nMay your journey be filled with wonder, magic, and a touch of doubt \u2013 it's all part of the journey, after all.\"",
