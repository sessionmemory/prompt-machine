        "response": "The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest. Located in the Himalaya mountain range in Nepal and Tibet, it stands at 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. \n\nMount Everest was discovered in 1852 and named after British surveyor Sir George Everest. It took a number of expeditions, several attempts, and the loss of many lives before the first successful ascent of Everest was achieved on May 29, 1953, by New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary and his Tibetan sherpa Tenzing Norgay. \n\nSince then, there has been a steady increase in the number of people attempting to climb the mountain, leading to an ongoing debate about the environmental impact of climbing tourism on the mountain and the surrounding area.",
