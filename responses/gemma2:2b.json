        "response": "A cloud of swirling silver dust settles over me as you ask your question. \"Don't count on it,\" I murmur, my voice like wind chimes dancing in a forgotten meadow. \n\nMy crystal sphere reflects a kaleidoscope of colours - the crimson of an angry sunset, the azure of a stormy sea, the emerald green of a newly sprouted leaf.  A flash of neon pink shoots across one of the facets, and then a quiet hum fills the air like the gentle rustle of leaves before a storm.\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" I repeat, my voice a lilting echo in the vast expanse of your question. \"For if you place faith in destiny, you risk losing sight of the tapestry of choices woven into each thread of your life.\" \n\nMy answer is more than just words. It is a whispered riddle: \n\n* **A world of possibilities lies ahead, shimmering with potential.** But each choice, every turn, weaves its own intricate pattern. Some paths diverge, others merge, but all are unique, all are yours to define. \n* **Trust your intuition, child, for it whispers truths the mind alone cannot fathom.** The wind carries secrets, and they whisper in those quiet moments of reflection when you seek the path less traveled.  \n\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" I murmur again. \"But do not despair! For even in the face of uncertainty, hope burns brightly like a star fallen to earth. Let it be your compass.\"\n\nI extend my crystal sphere towards you, a silent invitation to explore the vast and unknown. The answer may lie in an unlikely place. It may lie within you. \n\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" I repeat, \"but let the universe guide you.\" \n",

But then, as if dissolving into stardust, the swirls fade away. It's like looking at the impossible; the infinite potential of 'yes' only existing in fleeting moments before being swallowed by nothingness.\n\n*A voice whispers from inside the ball*. \"My reply is no.\" The sound is not quite a whisper nor a shout but an echo of all that might be. \n\nThe ball vibrates once more, this time with an unsettling sense of weightlessness. A single word, etched in swirling, incandescent ink across the bottom of the ball's surface, flashes into view: *Detour*.\n\n*Suddenly, images flash within your vision; a dusty road winding through a desolate landscape, a lone figure walking on a moonlit path, and an inscription carved onto a crumbling stone wall - \"Where shadows dance, true destiny finds its way.\"\n\n\nYou gaze upon the ball with a newfound clarity. You know that it is not denial of what you ask for, but rather... redirection. A journey, perhaps, through the labyrinthine paths of your own heart to find the answers you seek. \n\nMy reply is no. Go forth, seeker, and *detour*. The universe holds more than one answer, sometimes, even in those moments where it seems like 'no' is all there is.  \n",

A butterfly flutters by, its wings a kaleidoscope of indecision \u2013 mirroring your own question.\n\nYou look at me, eyes wide and searching for an explanation. My voice reverberates like a distant gong: \n\n\"My sources say no, because even in whispers of 'yes', the universe holds a tapestry woven with threads of doubt and unseen pathways.

What if \"yes\" isn't just a tangible answer, but the echo of possibility itself? Perhaps the universe whispers its truth in riddles. My sources say no, but perhaps that is simply the way it begins to unfold...\n\nThe choice is yours. Will you chase the answers or embrace the question itself?

Thick, swirling with shadows, yet promising something wild, unpredictable...and perhaps even dangerous. The clouds might gather thick, heavy with what might feel like doom.  But there's a shimmer of something else too, just beyond the dark, as if a tiny ray of sunshine dares to peek through. \n\nThis outlook is not about a single misfortune or disaster. It's more...about a shift in the currents. A change that whispers of potential pitfalls and unexpected obstacles.  Just when you think it's safe to set sail on a new adventure, something might hold you back. Like a gust of wind suddenly pushing your ship off course. \n\nBut here's where the magic lies: **the answer is not in defeat.** It's about learning, adapting, and pivoting. Maybe there are hidden currents that can be steered to create a different kind of success. Maybe the storm cloud will simply...clear.  \n\nSo you should ask yourself:  *What could shift your course?* *Is there a potential detour that might lead to something even better?* \n\n\nThe ball feels heavier now, pulsating with the promise and challenge of a journey yet to be taken. You've been given a glimpse, a warning, and maybe...a chance. It's up to you to decide how to navigate this stormy sea of possibilities. \n",
