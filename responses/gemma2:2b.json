A flash of neon pink shoots across one of the facets, and then a quiet hum fills the air like the gentle rustle of leaves before a storm.\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" I repeat, my voice a lilting echo in the vast expanse of your question. \"For if you place faith in destiny, you risk losing sight of the tapestry of choices woven into each thread of your life.\" \n\nMy answer is more than just words. It is a whispered riddle: \n\n* **A world of possibilities lies ahead, shimmering with potential.** But each choice, every turn, weaves its own intricate pattern. Some paths diverge, others merge, but all are unique, all are yours to define. \n* **Trust your intuition, child, for it whispers truths the mind alone cannot fathom.** The wind carries secrets, and they whisper in those quiet moments of reflection when you seek the path less traveled.  \n\n\n\"Don't count on it,\" I murmur again. \"But do not despair! For even in the face of uncertainty, hope burns brightly like a star fallen to earth.

But then, as if dissolving into stardust, the swirls fade away. It's like looking at the impossible; the infinite potential of 'yes' only existing in fleeting moments before being swallowed by nothingness.\n\n*A voice whispers from inside the ball*. \"My reply is no.\" The sound is not quite a whisper nor a shout but an echo of all that might be. \n\nThe ball vibrates once more, this time with an unsettling sense of weightlessness. A single word, etched in swirling, incandescent ink across the bottom of the ball's surface, flashes into view: *Detour*.\n\n*Suddenly, images flash within your vision; a dusty road winding through a desolate landscape, a lone figure walking on a moonlit path, and an inscription carved onto a crumbling stone wall - \"Where shadows dance, true destiny finds its way.\"\n\n\nYou gaze upon the ball with a newfound clarity. You know that it is not denial of what you ask for, but rather... redirection. A journey, perhaps, through the labyrinthine paths of your own heart to find the answers you seek. \n\nMy reply is no. Go forth, seeker, and *detour*. The universe holds more than one answer, sometimes, even in those moments where it seems like 'no' is all there is.  \n",

A butterfly flutters by, its wings a kaleidoscope of indecision \u2013 mirroring your own question.\n\nYou look at me, eyes wide and searching for an explanation. My voice reverberates like a distant gong: \n\n\"My sources say no, because even in whispers of 'yes', the universe holds a tapestry woven with threads of doubt and unseen pathways.

What if \"yes\" isn't just a tangible answer, but the echo of possibility itself? Perhaps the universe whispers its truth in riddles. My sources say no, but perhaps that is simply the way it begins to unfold...\n\nThe choice is yours. Will you chase the answers or embrace the question itself?

Thick, swirling with shadows, yet promising something wild, unpredictable...and perhaps even dangerous. The clouds might gather thick, heavy with what might feel like doom.  But there's a shimmer of something else too, just beyond the dark, as if a tiny ray of sunshine dares to peek through. \n\nThis outlook is not about a single misfortune or disaster. It's more...about a shift in the currents. A change that whispers of potential pitfalls and unexpected obstacles.  Just when you think it's safe to set sail on a new adventure, something might hold you back. Like a gust of wind suddenly pushing your ship off course. \n\nBut here's where the magic lies: **the answer is not in defeat.** It's about learning, adapting, and pivoting. Maybe there are hidden currents that can be steered to create a different kind of success. Maybe the storm cloud will simply...clear.  \n\nSo you should ask yourself:  *What could shift your course?* *Is there a potential detour that might lead to something even better?* \n\n\nThe ball feels heavier now, pulsating with the promise and challenge of a journey yet to be taken. You've been given a glimpse, a warning, and maybe...a chance. It's up to you to decide how to navigate this stormy sea of possibilities. \n",

        "prompt": "Hi! Please help me. I am new to using the I Ching, and I just asked it 'Should I quit my job?'. This was its answer: Hexagram 24: Fu (\u5fa9). So, what does it mean? Please interpret it for me. Also, it says I got a 'changing line' on the first (bottom) line. What is that?",
        "response": "You're diving into the fascinating world of I Ching! Here's an interpretation of your reading:\n\n**Hexagram 24: Fu (\u5fa9)**\n\nFu signifies **a journey back to the source**, often with a sense of **revival and renewal**. It suggests you may need to revisit past decisions or explore different paths to reach your true potential.  It represents a time for reflection, introspection, and re-evaluation.\n\n**Interpretation in Your Case:** \n\n* **Quitting Your Job**: The question is *about* changing your life path. Fu often points to a shift, a return to what you feel is essential or important, but it's not always about literal work. You might be feeling lost and looking for clarity on your direction.  \n* **\"Changing line\" (bottom line)**: The \"changing line\" in the hexagram signifies that this change may involve more than just leaving a job. There could be emotional, personal or even professional aspects to your decision. This suggests you'll need to consider the *why* and the potential impact of your choices on yourself, those around you, and on the bigger picture. \n\n**Possible Interpretations:**\n \n* **Reconsidering Your Path**: You may be in a transition phase where you're trying to figure out what you truly want. Fu encourages you to reflect and reassess your goals and values. \n* **Seeking Meaning**: The changing line suggests a change that has deeper roots than just the job itself. It could be about finding something meaningful or fulfilling.  It might be linked to personal growth, a new relationship, or exploration of different interests.\n* **Re-building & Re-purposing** : You may have been on a journey and this line suggests you are returning to where you started to rebuild or reframe your ambitions. \n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Don't act impulsively**: While Fu suggests change, it doesn't force you to quit immediately. This is about exploring your options, reflecting deeply, and understanding the consequences before deciding on a course of action.\n* **Honesty and Self-Awareness**:  The key to Fu's wisdom lies in self-reflection. Ask yourself \"What am I really looking for?\" and what steps can lead me to fulfillment? \n\n**Further Exploration:**\nTo get even deeper insights, consider these questions:\n\n* What were your reasons for wanting to quit your job? Is there a need for further clarification on your motivations?\n*  What aspects of your life are most important to you at this time? What brings you joy and fulfillment? \n\n\nRemember, the I Ching doesn't have definitive answers; it offers guidance and prompts reflection. Trust your intuition, follow your heart, and make choices that lead you toward a life of meaning and purpose.  \n\n\nLet me know if you want to delve deeper into any of these points or need further clarification!",
