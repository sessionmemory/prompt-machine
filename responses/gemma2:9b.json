        "response": "The answer depends on how you define \"tallest.\" \n\n* **Highest altitude above sea level:** Mount Everest, at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), is the highest point on Earth above sea level.\n\n* **Tallest from base to summit:** Mauna Kea in Hawaii is taller than Everest when measured from its base on the ocean floor to its summit. However, most of Mauna Kea is submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\nSo, while Mount Everest is the undisputed champion of altitude above sea level, Mauna Kea wins in terms of total height from base to peak. \n",
