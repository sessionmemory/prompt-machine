        "response": "The 'CODE' method is a framework for knowledge management developed by Tiago Forte, a productivity expert and writer. The acronym stands for Collect, Organize, Distill, and Express.\n\n1. Collect: This involves gathering information and ideas from various sources. It could be articles, books, social media posts, or personal notes. The goal is to capture potential value.\n\n2. Organize: Once the information is collected, it needs to be structured in a way that makes sense. This could involve tagging, categorizing, or creating a system of folders. The aim is to make the information easily retrievable.\n\n3. Distill: This step involves processing the information to extract its essence. It could mean summarizing articles, creating outlines, or making mind maps. The goal is to understand the information deeply and to create a form that can be easily reviewed and remembered.\n\n4. Express: The final step is to share what you've learned with others. This could be through writing a blog post, giving a presentation, or teaching someone else. The act of expressing knowledge helps to reinforce it in your own mind and can also provide value to others.",
