        "response": "The standard (or normal) boiling point of pure water at sea level atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa or 760 mmHg) is 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F). However, the boiling point can vary slightly due to impurities or pressure changes. At higher altitudes or lower atmospheric pressures, the boiling point decreases as there is less atmospheric pressure pushing on the liquid surface. Conversely, at higher pressures (such as in a pressure cooker), water can boil at temperatures above 100\u00b0C.",

        "response": "\"Stranger in a Strange Land\" by Heinlein, published in 1961, explores the concept of identity through the lens of religion and culture shock. The novel follows Michael Valentine Smith, who was born on Mars and raised by Martians before being brought to Earth as an adult. As he navigates human society, Smith challenges traditional religious beliefs and encourages a new understanding of spirituality that transcends cultural boundaries. Ultimately, the book explores themes of acceptance, tolerance, and the importance of open-mindedness in creating a more inclusive and compassionate world.\"",
