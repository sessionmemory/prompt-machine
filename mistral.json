The protagonist, Michael Valentine Smith, or \"Mike,\" as he is commonly known, possesses extraordinary abilities and a unique perspective on humanity due to his upbringing among Martians. As Mike interacts with various aspects of Earth culture, he challenges traditional norms and beliefs, ultimately helping to create a new religion, Valis, that emphasizes love, understanding, and the acceptance of others. The story serves as a critique of organized religion and societal expectations while exploring the universal desire for belonging, empathy, and self-discovery.",
